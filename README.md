I find it interesting when the article acknowledges the often strange behavior of these Generative AI. The software developing world is running into a new age of programming, companies have put lots of effort in integrating Generative AI. As we will have to adapt to this new apporach of programming, we will have to catch AI mistake. But, AI doesn't operate like a human, and will make mistake that that is way off from what we want. Tom Tauli, an author of mutiple AI books, gives an example of what these mistakes might look like, “For example, you can ask these LLMs [large language models] to create code and they sometimes make up a framework, or an imaginary library or module, to do what you want it to do.” It's strange that Generative AI, the new apporaches of software development that we are relying on, will make these mistakes like this.

Fatima Villena - I agree with the response and am also very intrigues by the newfound nature of AI in modern progrmming.  Not mentioned is that the article starts off quite stronging, with a quote from AWS CEO Matt Garman that he "expects most developers will no longer be coding as early as 2026.".  But the article also explains that perhaps the best usage of AI will be to use as a tool alongside development, with human supervision.
