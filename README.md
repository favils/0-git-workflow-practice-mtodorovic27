I find it interesting when the article acknowledges the often strange behavior of these Generative AI. The software developing world is running into a new age of programming, companies have put lots of effort in integrating Generative AI. As we will have to adapt to this new apporach of programming, we will have to catch AI mistake. But, AI doesn't operate like a human, and will make mistake that that is way off from what we want. Tom Tauli, an author of mutiple AI books, gives an example of what these mistakes might look like, “For example, you can ask these LLMs [large language models] to create code and they sometimes make up a framework, or an imaginary library or module, to do what you want it to do.” It's strange that Generative AI, the new apporaches of software development that we are relying on, will make these mistakes like this.


Ian Pompliano comment:

Generative AI, specifically LLMs are something I'm really interested in. I do think these strange behaviors are worth learning more about, as they could present many problems in the future. I think it is especially dangerous in fields like media and healthcare, where incorrect information can have really bad consequences.
